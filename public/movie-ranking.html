<h1>Best Movies According to Lenz</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>The movie ranks 1 in what in what I call "a perfect fiction". The characterisation, the plot and the act itself is topnotch.</p>
<h3>Legend of the Seeker</h3>
<p>The movie action is good with witty characters I find really interesting</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>Dune screenplay to me is very astonishing with perfect depiction of what I imagined the figures, machines and places to be like. I also love the choice of music, it added some layers of entertainment to it.</p>
